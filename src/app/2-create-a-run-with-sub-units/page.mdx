# Create a run with sub-units

Sometimes, units under test (UUT) include sub-units. They can be specified when creating runs, automatically linking them as children to the main unit for full traceability throughout manufacturing. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example with single sub-unit

Here's how to create a test run with sub-units:

```python {{ title: 'create_run_sub_unit.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import time

client = TofuPilotClient(api_key="Your API key goes here")

def test_function():
    # Your test execution goes here
    time.sleep(1)

    return True

run_passed = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "00002",
      "part_number": "PCB01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    sub_units=[{"serial_number": "00001"}]
)
```

<Note>
  Sub-units must be created first; new ones are added without replacing existing
  ones, and duplicates are ignored.
</Note>

## Check the Units page

You can now navigate to the Units page to see the hierarchy applied. Use the expand button to view the children of the tested units.

## Example with multiple sub-units

Here's how to create a test run with multi-units:

```python {{ title: 'create_run_sub_units.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import time

client = TofuPilotClient(api_key="Your API key goes here")

def test_function():
    # Your test execution goes here
    time.sleep(1)

    return True

run_passed = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "00003",
      "part_number": "PCB01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    sub_units=[{"serial_number": "00002"}, {"serial_number": "00001"}]
)
```
