## Overview

When testing your product with multiple procedures and phases, it can be challenging to know where to focus your efforts when issues arise or improvements are needed. In TofuPilot, each test phase is tracked individually, allowing you to analyze areas that need attention—whether it's phases taking too long, those with low yield, or measurement drifts over time.

## Single phase analysis

After a test run, go to the **Phases** table on the **Run page** to see details on the unit under test, procedure, attachments, report, and each test phase.

The **Phases** table includes each phase’s:

- name
- duration (milliseconds to hours)
- measurements’
  - name
  - value (number, string, boolean or abitrary JSON)
  - upper and lower limits
  - units (e.g., volts, degrees)
  - test status (Pass/Fail)

This view lets you analyze each phase in detail for a specific run.

<Note>
  Click on a test phase in the **Phases** table to go to the Procedure page,
  where data is sorted by that specific phase.
</Note>

## Multiple phases analysis

It's also helpful to get an overview across all executed runs, which you can access on the **Procedure page**. This page provides key indicators in various tabs (e.g., Cpk, yields). Learn more in the [Test analytics](/analytics) section.

On the Procedure page, you can filter the indicators for runs within the same procedure by selecting parameters at the top right:

- Run date
- Unit under test component and revision
- Unit under test batch number

You can also filter by phase in the **Phases by failure** or **Phases by duration** tables below.

<Note>
  Click on a phase (e.g., "thermal_reading" or "motor_noise") to filter by it.
  To clear the filter, select **Clear Filter**.

### Phases by failure and duration

This view helps you identify the most frequently failing test phases, making it easier to analyze defective parts or improve test procedures.

The **Phases by failure** table lists phases with a `Fail` status, sorted by frequency (from most to least failures).

The **Phases by duration** table displays phases sorted by `duration`, showing those that take the longest.

### Control chart and histogram

You can explore a specific test phase with numerical or string data in the **Control Chart** below the Phases tables.

This chart displays all values for the selected phase over time, showing limits, an automatically calculated 6-sigma standard deviation, and the average.

The histogram, with a Gaussian overlay, helps you quickly spot values outside the standard range.

<Note>
  Click on a phase with numeric or text values to display the **Control Chart**.
</Note>

### Phases by First-pass yield and Cpk

You can also view the First-Pass Yield and Cpk of each phase, helping you easily identify which test needs improvement to boost the overall yield. Keep in mind that the yield of a run is the cumulative result of all phase yields.
