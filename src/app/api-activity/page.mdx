## Overview

The API Activity dashboard gives you full visibility into your API usage. Track which endpoints are being called, monitor response times, and identify any failed or deprecated requests. It's your go-to tool for understanding system behavior and quickly debugging issues in production or integration.

Every API call is listed with detailed performance and usage metrics. Instantly see which endpoints are used most, how fast they respond, and where issues might be occurring.

## In-app View

Click on **API Activity** in the left menu to access the page. You'll see real-time monitoring of all API requests across your organization.

At the top of the page, you'll find:
- **Total Calls**: Total number of API requests
- **Success Rate**: A clear view of successful vs. failed requests
- **Avg Response**: Average response time across all calls
- **Deprecated**: Count of deprecated or invalid API calls detected

Below that, the dashboard displays a detailed list of API requests, sorted by most recent.

- Trace type and related message

The **API Traces timeline** shows a breakdown of internal processing steps, helping you understand the sequence and time spent on each.

You can toggle between **absolute time** and **relative time** from the start of the request.
