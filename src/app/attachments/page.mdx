## Overview

Hardware tests often generate extra data, like images, that can't be captured as measurements. TofuPilot uploads these attachments, allowing you to access and download them directly from your workspace.

## Integration

You can add attachments using OpenHTF's `attach` or `attach_from_file` functions. With TofuPilot Client, use the `attachments` field when creating a run with `create_run`.

## In-app view

A dedicated **Attachments** section is automatically created on the Runâ€™s page. Attachments can be viewed in the browser or downloaded.
