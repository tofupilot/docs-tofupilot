# Create a run with attachments

You can attach any file to a test run, such as images, graphs, or reports, by simply linking their local path during run creation. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example

Here's how to create a test run with a graph and a report attached:

<PythonExample path="create_run_with_attachments.py" />

## Check the new Run

Navigate to the Runs page to see your new run and its attachments under the Attachments section.

<Image src="/run-attachments.png" alt="Attachments section" />

<Note>
  After upload, attachments can be manually downloaded, added, or deleted at any
  time.
