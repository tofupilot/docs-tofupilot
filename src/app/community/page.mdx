## About us

We’re manufacturing test engineers working on robotics. We first built our own custom Python-based test framework — then switched to OpenHTF when we discovered it. When documentation was missing or scattered, we wrote our own. To keep up with fast-changing products on the line, we also built the tool we were missing: TofuPilot, a plug-and-play test database and analytics layer that lets us move quickly, stay agile, and keep production flowing.

If that sounds relevant to your work, you might like our newsletter — sent roughly every 3 weeks. We share feature updates, articles, and test templates we're building ourselves.

## Why we still use OpenHTF
OpenHTF has been a key tool for our team. Unsure about its current maintenance and future, we visited its founders, John and Joe, in Mountain View, and spoke with Akash, who now leads its maintenance at Waymo. In early 2025, we learned that OpenHTF is actively maintained by a dedicated team of five engineers, with no internal forks or breaking changes expected.
