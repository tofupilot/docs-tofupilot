## Download the Python client

To interact with the TofuPilot API effortlessly, install the TofuPilot Python client using this command:

```bash {{ title: 'bash' }}
pip install tofupilot
```

## Create a test run

A test run can now be easily created using a few parameters. Here is the code snippet:

<PythonExample path="create_run_basic.py" />

<Note>
  A default procedure named 'FVT1' is automatically created for your
  organization. If it has been deleted or you require a different procedure, you
  can create a new one from the Procedures page.
</Note>

## Check the Runs page

You can now navigate to the Runs page to view the newly created run.

<Image src={'/first-run.png'} alt={'Your first run'} />

Here are the operations handled by TofuPilot's servers:

- A new run was created from the procedure `FVT1`.
- The Unit `00102` was automatically created as it did not exist.
- The Unit was linked to Component `PCB01`, which was also automatically created since it did not exist.
- Since `run_passed` is `True`, the run was assigned a `Pass` status.
