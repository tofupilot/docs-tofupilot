# OpenHTF

Integrate your OpenHTF scripts with TofuPilot in a single line. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Image src="/openhtf-header.png" alt="" />

## Overview

[OpenHTF](https://openhtf.com) is an open-source Python framework for automating hardware tests. It makes writing and running tests easier with a modular design. Built at Google, it's now used by teams around the world.

By adding a **single line** to your OpenHTF script, TofuPilot's open-source Python client automatically creates a run on TofuPilot, capturing the test phases, measurements, and attachments, and storing the original OpenHTF JSON log for traceability.

## Installation

1. [Create a TofuPilot account](https://tofupilot.app/auth/signup)

2. Install OpenHTF:

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`pip install openhtf six setuptools`}
/>

3. Install the TofuPilot open-source Python client:

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`pip install tofupilot`}
/>

Add it to your test like this:

<File
  branch="main"
  path="docs/openhtf/integrations/main.py"
/>


Your OpenHTF reports are uploaded to your TofuPilot account using the Unit Under Test serial number `dut_id` (e.g., "PCB001"), which you can find on the **Runs** page.
