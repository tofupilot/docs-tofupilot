## 1. Creat your account

To get started, [create a free account](https://tofupilot.app/auth/signup) or join an existing organization by [invitation](/user-management#invite-user).


## 2. Simulate a test run

Once you're logged in, the **Welcome aboard** page walks you through simulating test runs using either Python or OpenHTF scripts. No hardware required.

## 3. Upload to TofuPilot

To connect your script, add your [API key](/user-management#api-key), define the [procedure parameters](/procedures#integration), and include data for the [unit under test](/unit-under-test-uut#integration). Your test runs will show up in TofuPilot automatically.

<Note>
  We recommend using **virtualenv** for isolated Python environments. Learn how
  to set one up for:
  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_virtual-environments),
  [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html),
  [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Virtualenv).
</Note>

## 4. What's next?

Congratulations on uploading your first test run to TofuPilot! ðŸŽ‰
From here, youâ€™ll add test measurements, stations, and more. The next guides show you how.

### About us

Weâ€™re robotics-focused manufacturing test engineers. We started with a custom Python framework, later switching to OpenHTF â€” but found the tooling ecosystem lacking. So we built what we needed: **TofuPilot**, a plug-and-play test database and analytics layer to keep production agile and traceable.


### Why we still use OpenHTF
OpenHTF remains core to what we do. In early 2025, we met with its founders and current maintainers at Waymo. Itâ€™s actively maintained by a team of five engineers, with no breaking changes or forks expected.
