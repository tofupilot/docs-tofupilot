# Procedures

Define your test sequence for your Units Under Test. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Image src="/procedure-header.png" alt="" />

## Overview

The Procedures allow you to set up the test sequence for one or more units under test. It provides analytics and test performances across multiple runs, including average test duration, yields, Cpk, and Control Chart for numerical values.

## Integration

You can create a new procedure automatically from your test scripts by setting its ID, name, Unit Under Test, and test status.

### Basic parameters

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGithub
    title="OpenHTF"
    branch="main"
    path="docs_tofupilot/procedures/openhtf/main.py"
  />

  <CodeGithub
    title="Python"
    branch="main"
    path="docs_tofupilot/procedures/client/main.py"
  />
</CodeGroup>

<Properties>
  <Property name="procedure_id" type="str">
    Define unique procedure ID.
  </Property>
  <Property name="procedure_name" type="str (optional)">
    Set or rename the procedure name.
  </Property>
  <Property name="run_passed" type="bool">
    Set Pass/Fail status of the procedure.
  </Property>
  <Property name="duration" type="timedelta (optional)">
    Determine duration of the test.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Note>
  If a run has `phases` and its `duration` was not provided, the `duration` will
  be automatically calculated as the sum of the durations of its phases
</Note>

### Advanced parameters

You can define several important additional parameters for your procedures, each covered in a separate section:

- Define **[Unit under test (UUT)](/unit-under-test-uut)**, which includes serial number, batch, revision, and part number.
- Break down test **[Phases](/phases)**
- Add **[Sub-units](/sub-units)** during assembly
- Include file **[Attachments](/attachments)**

## In-app view

In TofuPilot, you can explore different procedures in the **Procedures** tab. On a Procedure page (for example, `procedure_id` FVT1 with the `procedure_name` PCB Testing), you can navigate between various tabs that display analytics for all runs executed from this procedure. These include:

- The status of **Runs** over time, defined by `run_passed`
- The average test **Duration** over time, compute from `duration`
- **First-Pass Yield**
- **Cpk** for tests with numerical measurements and limits.

These features will be explained in more detail in the [Test phases analysis](/analysis) section.
