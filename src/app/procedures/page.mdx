# Procedures

Define your test sequence for your Units Under Test. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Image src="/procedure-header.png" alt="" />

## Overview

The Procedures allow you to set up the test sequence for one or more units under test. It provides analytics and test performances across multiple runs, including average test duration, yields, Cpk, and Control Chart for numerical values.

## Integration

First, you need to create a new procedure in the TofuPilot interface. Go to **Procedures** page and click the **Create Procedure** button.

Once the procedure is created, you can upload your Runs using the `procedure_id` parameter to link them to the correct Procedure. Youâ€™ll also need to set the Unit Under Test and the test status.

### Basic parameters

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGithub
    title="OpenHTF"
    branch="main"
    path="docs_tofupilot/procedures/openhtf/main.py"
  />

  <CodeGithub
    title="Vanilla Python"
    branch="main"
    path="docs_tofupilot/procedures/client/main.py"
  />
</CodeGroup>

<Properties>
  <Property name="procedure_id" type="str">
    Define unique procedure ID. You can view or rename it on the Procedure page in the application.
  </Property>
  <Property name="run_passed" type="bool">
    Set the Pass/Fail status of the procedure.
  </Property>
  <Property name="unit_under_test" type="array">
    Specify the [Unit under test (UUT)](/unit-under-test-uut) being tested.
  </Property>
  <Property name="phases" type="array (optional)">
      Break down test by [phases](/phases#phases-integration).
  </Property>
  <Property name="started_at" type="str (optional)">
    ISO 8601 start time of the Run. _Example: "2024-09-11T08:00:00Z"_
  </Property>
  <Property name="duration" type="timedelta (optional)">
    Specify the duration of the test.
  </Property>
  <Property name="procedure_version" type="str (optional)">
    Define the version of the procedure.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Note>
    You can define the `duration` of the Run and the `duration` of individual Phases independently using the Python client. In OpenHTF, the Run duration is automatically computed based on the sum of all Phases durations.
</Note>


### Advanced parameters

You can define several important additional parameters for your procedures, each covered in a separate section:

- Break down test by **[Phases and Measurements](/phases)**
- Define **[Unit under test (UUT)](/unit-under-test-uut)**, which includes serial number, batch, revision, and part number.
- Add **[Sub-units](/sub-units)** during assembly
- Include file **[Attachments](/attachments)**

## In-app view

In TofuPilot, you can explore different procedures in the **Procedures** tab. On a Procedure page (for example, `procedure_id` FVT1, titled "PCBA Test"), you can navigate through various tabs that display analytics for all runs executed from this procedure. These include:

- The status of **Runs** over time, based on `run_passed`
- The average test **Duration** over time, compute from `duration`
- The **First-Pass Yield**
- **Cpk** for tests with numerical measurements and defined limits.

These features will be explained in more detail in the [Test phases analysis](/analysis) section.


### Rename a procedure

You can rename Procedure name or its `procedure_id` directly in the application. Go to the **Procedure** page, then select **Edit ID** or **Edit Name** from the menu.
