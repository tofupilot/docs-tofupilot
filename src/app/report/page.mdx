# Create a run with report variables

Each TofuPilot run includes a Report section with a rich text editor, inheriting the report from the Procedure they are created from. Custom variables can be defined in the template and assigned values when the run is created. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Create report template with variables

To create variables in a procedure report template, wrap the variable name in double curly brackets: `{{variable-name}}`. These fields will then become customizable inputs.

<Note>
  Variables can be inserted into any editor block (lists, tables, code blocks,
  etc.) and can include applied styles.

## Set values programmatically

Create a run from the procedure and use the `report_variables` parameter to populate the variables fields.

<PythonExample path="create_run_with_report_variables.py" />

## Check your run report

Access the report of the newly created run where variables have been automatically populated.
