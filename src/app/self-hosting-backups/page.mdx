## Overview

This page outlines what data to back up when self-hosting TofuPilot. It identifies critical Docker volumes and provides recommendations to ensure reliable recovery and long-term data durability.


## Volumes to Back Up

Ensure the following Docker volumes are included in your backup routine:

- **`database-data`**:
  Contains all database files, including schema definitions, configurations, and application data. Backup this volume to preserve your database's state and integrity.

- **`storage-data`**:
  Stores user-uploaded files such as profile pictures, attachments, and other assets. Backup this volume to safeguard external content and binary data.

## Backup Recommendations

Integrate these volumes into your backup process using methods like volume snapshots, off-site replication, or encrypted storage to ensure data durability and smooth recovery in case of failure or migration.
