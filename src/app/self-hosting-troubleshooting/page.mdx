## Overview

This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues when self-hosting TofuPilot. It covers architecture-specific errors (such as on Apple Silicon), port conflicts, SSL setup, and how to check service status.

## ARM64 Architecture (Apple Silicon)

If you encounter an "exec format error" on ARM64 systems:

1. **Docker Desktop (Mac)**: Enable Rosetta emulation

   - Go to Docker Desktop → Settings → General → Enable Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation

2. **Install QEMU emulators**:

    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install all`}
    />

## Port Conflicts

If ports 80 or 443 are already in use, check for conflicting services:

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E ':80|:443'`}
/>

## SSL Certificate Issues

If HTTPS is not working immediately after installation:

- Certificate generation may take a few minutes.
- Check the certificate status:

    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`curl -I https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com`}
    />

- Make sure your DNS records correctly point to your server’s public IP.

## Service Status

To confirm that all services are running properly:

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`docker compose ps`}
/>

To view detailed service logs:

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`docker compose logs -f`}
/>
