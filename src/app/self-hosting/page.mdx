## Overview

By default, TofuPilot accounts are hosted on our secure, high-performance, AWS-based cloud infrastructure. This includes automated updates and removes the burden of infrastructure management.

For organizations with strict IT policies or specific network requirements, TofuPilot can be self-hosted.

## System Requirements

Ensure your server meets the following minimum specifications:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|----------------|
| **OS**      | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (64-bit) |
| **CPU**     | 2 cores or more |
| **RAM**     | 4 GB or more |
| **Storage** | At least 20 GB of free disk space (more may be required depending on run attachments) |
| **Access**  | Sudo privileges required |
| **Network** | Open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) |

## Domains

Prepare your domain and DNS settings for self-hosting:

- **Application Domain**: Register a domain or subdomain for TofuPilot (e.g., `tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **Storage Domain**: Register a subdomain for storing attachments (e.g., `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **DNS Records**: Create two A records:
  - `tofupilot.yourcompany.com` → your server's public IPv4 address
  - `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com` → your server's public IPv4 address
- **SSL Certificate**: Ensure a valid email address is available for SSL certificate registration via Let’s Encrypt.

## Authentication

TofuPilot does not store user passwords. It supports two secure authentication methods:

1. **Email Authentication** – Users receive a one-time code via email to log in.
2. **OAuth Authentication** – Users log in via Microsoft or Google accounts.

You must enable **at least one** method to allow user sign-in.

### Email Authentication

To enable email-based login, configure your SMTP settings:

- **SMTP Host**: Your email server's hostname (e.g., `smtp.yourdomain.com`)
- **SMTP Port**: Usually `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **From Address**: Email address used to send login codes (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`)
- **SMTP Username**: Email account username (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`)
- **SMTP Password**: Email account password or app-specific password

### Microsoft Entra ID OAuth

To enable Microsoft login:

1. Visit the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Manage** > **App registrations**.
3. Register a new application with:
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id`
   - **Supported Account Types**: Choose according to your organization (e.g., single or multi-tenant)
4. After registration, collect the following:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Tenant ID**
   - **Client Secret** (create under **Certificates & secrets**)

### Google OAuth

To enable Google login:

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Under **Credentials**, create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
3. Set the **Authorized Redirect URI**:
   - `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/google`
4. Save the following:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
