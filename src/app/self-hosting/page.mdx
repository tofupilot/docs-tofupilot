# Self-Hosting

Self-host TofuPilot for scenarios where managed cloud is not an option. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

TofuPilot accounts are hosted on our AWS-powered cloud, managed by our team. This ensures strong security, high performance, automatic updates, and removes the need for your infrastructure management.

For strict IT policies or specific connectivity needs, TofuPilot can also be self-hosted.

## Prerequisites

### Enterprise trial

Contact [our team](https://www.tofupilot.com/contact/sales) to sign up for an **Enterprise** plan trial. We will grant you access to the private self-hosting installation repository along with the TofuPilot docker image.

All the tests stored in your TofuPilot Cloud instance can be seamlessly migrated to your self-hosted version by our team.

### System Requirements

Ensure your server meets the minimum specifications.

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (64-bit)
- **CPU**: 2 cores or more
- **RAM**: 4 GB or more
- **Storage**: 20 GB of free disk space, or more depending on your run attachments needs
- **Access**: Sudo access to your server.
- **Network**: Open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)

### Domains

Ensure your domain and DNS settings are prepared for self-hosting:

- **Domain Name**: Register a domain or subdomain for TofuPilot (e.g., `tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **Storage Domain Name**: Register a subdomain for TofuPilot storage (e.g., `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **DNS Records**: Create two A records in your DNS settings:
  - Point `tofupilot.yourcompany.com` to your server's public IPv4 address.
  - Point `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com` to the same public IPv4 address.
- **SSL Certificate**: Ensure you have a valid email address for registering the SSL certificate with Letâ€™s Encrypt.

## Authentication

TofuPilot does not store user passwords in its database and offers two secure methods for user sign-up and authentication:

1. **Email Authentication**: Users sign in by receiving a magic code sent to their email.
2. **OAuth Authentication**: Users sign in using their Microsoft or Google accounts.

You must enable **at least one** authentication method based on your requirements.

### Email

To enable email-based authentication, retrieve the following SMTP server details:

- **SMTP Host**: The hostname of your email server (e.g., `smtp.yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP Port**: Typically `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL.
- **Email From Address**: The email address that will send the magic codes (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP User**: The username for your email account (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP Password**: The password or app-specific password for your email account.

To enable OAuth authentication, create an authorized application in your Google or Microsoft account:

### Microsoft OAuth

1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > Manage > **App registrations**.
3. Register a new application with these details:
   - **Redirect URI**: e.g. `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
   - Set **Supported Account Types** to match your needs (e.g., single tenant or multi-tenant).
4. After registration, retrieve the following:
   - **Application (client) ID**
   - **Directory (tenant) ID**
   - **Client Secret**: Create a client secret under **Certificates & secrets**.

### Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID under **Credentials**.
3. Configure the following:
   - **Authorized Redirect URI**: `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/google`
4. Retrieve the following:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

## Deploy

Once prerequisites are complete, installation is straightforward.

1. SSH into your server:

   Connect to your server via its IP address using SSH, or [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) on Windows:

   <Code
    language="bash"
    code={`ssh user@your_server_ip`}
    />

2. Install Git, Docker and Docker-Compose
    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install docker.io
    sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
    sudo apt install git`}
      />

3. Clone the installation repository shared by our team.
    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`git clone https://github.com/tofupilot/self-hosting.git && cd self-hosting`}
      />

4. Run the deployment script:
    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`chmod +x ./deploy.sh
    sudo bash ./deploy.sh`}
      />

   Answer the following questions when prompted:

   <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`Hostname for your TofuPilot? [tofupilot.example.com]:
   Hostname for your TofuPilot storage? [storage.tofupilot.example.com]:
   Email address associated with your domain (for SSL)? [me@example.com]:
   Google Client ID? (leave blank if not using Google auth):
   Google Client Secret? (leave blank if not using Google auth):
   Azure AD Client ID? (leave blank if not using Azure AD auth):
   Azure AD Client Secret? (leave blank if not using Azure AD auth):
   Azure AD Tenant ID? (leave blank if not using Azure AD auth):
   SMTP server address? (leave blank if not using Email auth):
   SMTP port? (leave blank if not using Email auth):
   SMTP user name? (leave blank if not using Email auth):
   SMTP password? (leave blank if not using Email auth):
   Email address used as 'from' in emails? (leave blank if not using Email auth):`}
      />


## Post-Installation

Once the script finishes, access the web app (e.g., `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com`) to create an admin account, and set up an organization (we recommend naming it `app`).

You can upload test runs using the public TofuPilot Python package. Simply set your instance URL with the `url` parameter as shown below. All features described in the rest of the documentation will function as expected.

<CodeGroup>
    <Code title="OpenHTF" language="python" code={`import openhtf as htf
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot

def main():
        test = htf.Test(
              procedure_id="FVT1",
              part_number="PCB1",
              )

with TofuPilot(test, url="https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com"): # specify URL here
        test.execute(lambda: "PCB1A001")

if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    `} />


    <Code title="Vanilla Python" language="python" code={`from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta

  def main():
      client = TofuPilotClient(url="https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com") # specify URL here

      client.create_run(
          procedure_id="FVT1",
          run_passed=True,
          unit_under_test={
                "serial_number": "PCB1A001",
                "part_number": "PCB1"},
          duration=timedelta(minutes=1, seconds=45),
      )

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()`}  />

</CodeGroup>

## Update

To update your self-hosted TofuPilot app to the latest version, follow the following steps:

1. Pull the latest changes:
    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`git pull origin main`}
      />

2. Restart the docker containers:
    <Code
      language="bash"
      code={`docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --pull always`}
      />

## Backups

Ensure the following Docker volumes are included in your backup routine:

### **Volumes to Back Up**

- **`database-data`**:
  Contains all database files, including schema definitions, configurations, and application data. Backup this volume to preserve your database's state and integrity.

- **`storage-data`**:
  Stores user-uploaded files such as profile pictures, attachments, and other assets. Backup this volume to safeguard external content and binary data.

### **Backup Recommendations**

Integrate these volumes into your backup process using methods like volume snapshots, off-site replication, or encrypted storage to ensure data durability and smooth recovery in case of failure or migration.
