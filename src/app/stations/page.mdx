# Stations

Deploy your test stations either in-house or at your suppliers. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

Deploying test procedures in production often means duplicating test benches across multiple suppliers or production sites. At the same time, it's crucial to control write access, ensuring only authorized procedures and components are tested. Stations in TofuPilot make it easy to share procedures across physical benches, manage access, and accurately track analytics.

## Integration

To create a station in TofuPilot:

1. Go to the **Stations** tab.
2. Click **Create Station** and enter a name. A unique station ID (e.g., STA1) will be generated.
3. **Generate the API key** and link relevant procedures to the station.

Use the generated API key in your TofuPilot client by passing it as the `api_key` argument in your script or storing it in your environment variables. Check **[Account management](/user-management#api-key)** for more details.

In your script, make sure to use the `procedure_id` linked to your station when pushing test runs to TofuPilot.

You can also monitor yield and weekly runs for each linked procedure.

### Filter Procedures by Station
In the **Procedures** section, you can filter test runs by Stations to view data from a specific station, along with related Components and Batch numbers.
