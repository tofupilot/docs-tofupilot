# Create a run with sub-units

TofuPilot supports sub-units within units under test (UUT), and it will automatically link them accordingly when creating runs for seamless traceability throughout assembly. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example with single sub-unit

Here's how to create a test run with sub-units:

<PythonExample path="create_run_single_sub_unit.py" />

<Note>
  Sub-units must be created first; new ones are added without replacing existing
  ones, and duplicates are ignored.
</Note>

## Check the Units page

You can now navigate to the Units page to see the hierarchy applied. Use the expand button to view the children of the tested units.

## Example with multiple sub-units

Here's how to create a test run with multi-units:

<PythonExample path="create_run_multiple_sub_units.py" />
