# Traceability

Trace the activity of your unit under tests. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

Traceability helps identify defective parts, isolate faulty units, monitor assemblies during production, track components, and analyze defects for continuous improvement.

TofuPilot allows you to visualize units, their components, revisions, and batch numbers. It also tracks when units were tested or assembled as sub-units with others during tests, all the way to the final product.

## Components

Units Under Tests are organized by Components with a unique `part_number`.
On the **Components page**, you can view the quantity of units produced for each component, and you can sort them by:

- part number
- name
- revision

/>

On a specific **Component page**, you can :

- Add images
- Modify the name, part number, and revision
- View the procedures used to test this component
- View the units tested, along with their test runs and creation dates

## Units

Each unit is unique and identified by its serial number. It is always linked to a component and contains the following information:

- Creation date (first test/run date)
- May have a batch number
- May have associated parent or sub-units
- Runs

### Activity

You can track a unit's activity from its creation date, marks by its first run, through its various tests and assemblies. You can identify if a part was reassembled to pass a test and review all procedures performed on the unit.
